				<p class="desc">Hey guys, I’m Ava and I’m Secretary General. I’ve been in the club since freshman year and this is my second time running a conference. I’m the president of the club because my father is Zeus and people find me to be edgy, intimidating, and “borderline psychopathic” (as my therapist puts it). At our first iMUNC I was COER and I ran our futuristic security council. In my free time I enjoy watching endless crime shows and wearing halloween make up year round.</p>

				<p class="desc">Hi guys! My name is Ivy Trocco and I am a senior at the NYC iSchool. I am the Under-Secretary General. This is my second time running a conference. Last time I was a chair, this time I am just working behind the scenes. I have been in Model UN since freshman year. I will be the one with the red hair giving a speech at the beginning. I know all of our committees are weird but that’s because our school isn't like the others. Thank you all for coming, I hope to meet you all soon.</p>

				<p class="desc">My name is Carmen and I strongly enjoy making others suffer for my own enjoyment. I will force you to abide by every single rule and if you are one hair out of line I will laugh at you until you cry from embarrassment :). Other than that, I’ve been doing MUN for just over a year, I’ve been to nine conferences. I’m also the club’s Under Secretary General of Communications and Fundraising.</p>

				<p class="desc">My name is Lucas Kulin, this is my first time hosting a conference. I, like most others in our Model UN club, have worked very hard to design and build my committee in the hopes that it will be fun, imaginative, and hopefully chaotic in some way. I wish you all luck at your assigned committees and hope that you all find them fun or interesting. My formality when writing these bios is often destructive to what i am trying to express.</p>

I worked hard to create an interesting and fun committee that’s full of surprises. I like looming and shopping. I’m really friendly, nice, and I just want to have fun. I also want to watch the world burn and I’m bad at this so I’m going to stop writing stuff.</p>

				<p class="desc">Hello my name is Wittika Chaplet, this is my first time hosting a conference and being a co-chair. I joined Model UN club halfway through last year so I’m new at this even though I’m a senior. I hope you guys enjoy the very serious and relevant issues we’ve created for this conference. In my free time I enjoy being a part-time witch and having a really long name that no one can pronounce. Welcome to the iSchool, “in case you haven’t noticed, [we’re] weird. [We’re] a weirdo. [We] don’t fit in. And [we] don’t want to fit in. Have you ever seen [us] without this stupid hat on? That’s weird.”</p>

I’m a friendly, enthusiastic person who is always up for some good debate. I love to fix things, have been building computers since age 11, and I'm a fiery advocate for Socialist economics. A veteran of Model UN, there is little I haven’t seen on the floor of the GA. I look forward to meeting all of you at our iMUN Conference.</p>

I really love debating and I hope you do as well. This is my first time running a conference and I am very excited. Everyone in our Model UN club has been working extremely hard to make this conference fun for you. When I’m not working on this I enjoy writing, reading, and photography.</p>

I like to think of myself as a friendly person. In my freetime, I am on a JOAD (Junior Olympic Archery Division) team and I really enjoy it, I have been shooting since I was 9. I am really looking forward to iMUNC and I hope that you are too.</p>

I decided to join Model UN in freshman year. I am going to be in the backroom during the debate so you won’t see me as much. But, I love reading, figure skating, and laughing. I can’t wait to meet everyone!</p>

This is my first time co-chairing and my first time hosting a conference. My main purpose is to keep my chair in line, and keep him from randomly nuking England, or something.</p>

I enjoy banana suits and living life to the fullest, especially because I’ll likely die before 25. I have been doing Model UN since middle school. This is my first time hosting a conference, although I was involved in the very preliminary stages of planning the last one. I’m excited to get another use out of my purple suit from Halloween 2016 (Get ready).</p>

I’m also an OG member of the Model UN club, but I suck at conducting research for debate… I’ll be doing a whole bunch of stuff behind the scenes to keep everything under control while the conference is running, so you’ll likely see me around.</p>
